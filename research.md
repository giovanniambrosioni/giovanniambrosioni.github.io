## Papers and preprints
<h2>Research interests</h2>
I am interested in categorical symplectic geometry and its persistence version.

<h3>Some notes about topics I like to think about</h3>
Here are some notes that I wrote over the years. Some of this material will converge in my thesis in March 2026.
<ul>
<li>A detailed guide to Abouzaid's algebraic split-generation criterion, with and without $A_\infty$-modules</li>
<li>Smoothness, split-generation and Abouzaid criterion following Ganatra, with a naive idea on how to prove equivalence.
<li>Introduction to persistence and triangulation in Lagrangian topology</li>
<li>Some quantitative results on split-generation which will not appear anytime soon</li>
<li>Errata on unitality of filtered Fukaya categories (thanks to Mohammed Abouzaid for pointing out the mistake.)</li>
<li>Quasi-rigidity of Lagrangians in approximable Fukaya categories: relation to Viterbo conjecture and the equator conjecture</li>
</ul>
